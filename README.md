# Advent of Code 2021 in TypeScript

I'm an experienced JavaScript developer but I don't know TypeScript. Let's see what happens when my JavaScript skills collide with dimly remembered statically typed compiled language knowledge! From, like, the nineties!

If you're not familiar, [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an enjoyable 25-day programming challenge with something for every level of experience. Some years I finish, other years I'm busy. Always fun.

## How to run these

```
npm install
npx ts-node day-1a.ts
```

I also have an alias in my `~/.bash_profile`:

```
alias ts="npx ts-node"
```

... So I can type `ts day-1a.ts`.
